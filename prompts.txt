Create me an App for WaterHub, I want it to be an app with a simple account creation page and a landing page, the main focus on the app is educating clients on water quality but also has a feature for a self diagnosis water test at home, it won't actually be a full water test but it's most so a questionare relating to symptoms of hard and chlorinated water. I want the app to link back to WaterHub.co and also incorporate this link tree URL https://linktr.ee/WaterHub.co  the app must be compatible with Android and IOS
